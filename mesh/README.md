%   Here we make the rules for naming the mesh, 
%   such as: 'S_quadmesh_4times2_[0_1]_[1-2_1]',
%       S_quadmesh, is the mesh name,
%       4time2, is the x-coordinate and y-coordinate elem arrange,
%       [0_1], is the x-coordinate domain [0,1]
%       [1-2_1], is the y-coordinate domain [1/2,1], and 1-2 is the transformation of 1/2.
